#collection of TODOs:

#(detection)
#fix polygon and rect classes, lay them out more logically

#collisions between two moving objects
#crowd collisions / multiple collisions (more than 3)
#(these are more long term)

#optimizations;
#computing "blueprint polygons" for every set of polygons that might collide

#(mathsupp)
#faster handling of vectors (find a library? (numpy?))
#faster functions

#(response)        
#smooth mechanics;
#proper jumping 
#fix sliding
#introduce stable bumping mechanics
#friction with surfaces

#etc
#fix collisions with multiple (2-3) objects

#(quadtree)
##REDO
