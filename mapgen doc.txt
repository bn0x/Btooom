<vegard1992> err
<vegard1992> random generation isnt exactly a cakewalk but
<vegard1992> in short
<vegard1992> well
<vegard1992> i cant really say much unless i know exactly what will be on the map 
<!obnoxious> like uhmm
<vegard1992> but assuming just a forsest of grass and obstacles like trees and bushes
<!obnoxious> boulders
<!obnoxious> trees
<!obnoxious> etc
<vegard1992> i.e. walkable and unwalkable tiles
<vegard1992> and nothjng morie advanced than that
<vegard1992> with a sort of "cramped" feel
<vegard1992> we will generate many small rooms and connect them
<vegard1992> so the rooms / corridors between are walkable
<vegard1992> the rest is unwalkable
<vegard1992> walkable = grass
<vegard1992> unwalkable = random stuff we put herea nd there (trees, boulders, bushes)
<!obnoxious> yea
<!obnoxious> also
<!obnoxious> for the bombs 
<jhpy1024> I always have trouble with collision detection.
<vegard1992> so how good it looks dependsm ostly on the generated art
<!obnoxious> I want some sort of gradient affect with the damage
<!obnoxious> like
<!obnoxious> for example
<!obnoxious> if a bomb explodes and you are right on top of it
<!obnoxious> its an instant kill
<vegard1992> im gonna copypaste this as a doc for the map gen
